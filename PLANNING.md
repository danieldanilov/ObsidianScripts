# Project Planning

## Goals
- Maintain a collection of personal Obsidian utility scripts.
- Make scripts potentially useful for others.

## Architecture
- Standalone Python scripts run from the command line.
- Each script targets a specific Obsidian vault maintenance task.

## Naming Conventions
- Script names should be descriptive (e.g., `verb_noun_description.py`).
- Use snake_case for filenames and variables/functions within scripts.

## Constraints
- Scripts should be self-contained where possible.
- Dependencies should be minimized or clearly documented.

## Decisions
- For now, script explanations will be kept within docstrings at the top of each file rather than in separate READMEs per script.

## Dependencies/Setup
- Python 3.x
