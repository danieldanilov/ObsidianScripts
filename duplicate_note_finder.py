Duplicate Note Finder for Obsidian

This script identifies markdown notes with identical filenames across different
folders in an Obsidian vault. It traverses the entire vault directory structure,
collects all markdown files (*.md), and reports any duplicate filenames along with
their full paths.

Technical Implementation:
- Uses os.walk() to recursively traverse all directories in the vault
- Maintains a dictionary to track filenames and their paths
- Ignores specified directories (like .git, .trash, etc.)
- Outputs results to console, showing duplicate filenames and their locations
- Can be customized to ignore specific directories via the IGNORED_DIRS list
